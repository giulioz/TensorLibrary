# tensor-library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/giulioz/TensorLibrary.svg?branch=assignment2)](https://travis-ci.org/giulioz/TensorLibrary)

Second Assignment for Advanced algorithms and programming methods [CM0470] course.

We made some changed to an existing Tensor Library to allow operations using the Einstein Notation.
The special Einstein Notation for tensors allows summation, subtraction and multiplication using indices:

Good morning,

Our solution to the second assignement of Advanced algorithms and programming methods [CM0470] is attached. A description on how to interact with the Tensor Library is present in the README file. We made the following design choices:

Our build environment works with CMake, so the build process is:
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make

We set up also basic unit tests and TravisCI to ensure quality and memory safety.
